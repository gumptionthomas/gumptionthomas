### ü§ì Tech Biography (exhausting)

I am an enthusiastic, lifelong software developer with a couple decades of experience developing varied software projects in several different languages.

My first paid software project was a biorhythms generator written in BASIC for the Atari 8-bit OS. It was published in [Antic Magazine, January 1988](https://archive.org/details/1988-01-anticmagazine) when I was a high-school student.

Since then:

I have developed cross-platform digital imaging capture and manipulation applications for Mac/Windows in C++ while managing a small team of developers.

I architected and developed the first Service Oriented Architecture in Java for a Fortune 5 health insurance company, while building and managing a larger team of service developers.

I replatformed a proprietary (and expensive) architecture to an open-source Java architecture for a Fortune 100 airline.

I‚Äôve spent the last 15 years as a software consultant and developer, focusing on Python and cloud applications (primarily on Google Cloud Platform) working for both small and large companies. 

I have attempted (unsuccessfully üôÅ) to bootstrap three of my own software startups for which I was the sole developer.

I continue to tinker with new development technologies on useful-to-me projects, writing lots of code no one will ever see. And that's okay, because I'm a coder at heart.
