I am an enthusiastic, lifelong software developer with a couple decades of experience developing varied software projects in several different languages.

I have developed cross-platform digital imaging capture and manipulation applications for Mac/Windows in C++ while managing a small team of developers.

I architected and developed the first Service Oriented Architecture in Java for a Fortune 5 health insurance company, while building and managing a larger team of service developers.

I replatformed a proprietary (and expensive) architecture to an open-source Java architecture for a Fortune 100 airline.

I’ve spent the last 15 years as a software consultant and developer, focusing on Python and cloud applications (primarily on Google Cloud Platform) working for both small and large companies. 

I have attempted (unsuccessfully 🙁) to bootstrap three of my own software startups for which I was the sole developer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [`zaphodvox`](https://github.com/gumptionthomas/zaphodvox), an open-source python package that provides a command-line interface for encoding a text file into synthetic speech audio using either the [Google Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs) or the [ElevenLabs Speech Synthesis API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs).

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on either of my open-source projects: `zaphodvox` or [`cancelchain`](https://github.com/cancelchain/cancelchain) (an open-source python project that implements a custom, non-cryptocurrency blockchain ledger).

- ⚡ Fun fact: My first paid software project was a biorhythms generator written in BASIC for the Atari 8-bit OS. It was published in [Antic Magazine, January 1988](https://archive.org/details/1988-01-anticmagazine) when I was a high-school student.
